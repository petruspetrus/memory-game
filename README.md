## Description

This project provides a web based version of the memory game based on javascript. As you would expect,
index.html provides the web presentation, app.js the code driving the game and app.css the styling

## Dependencies

This project uses standard javascript, html and css with symbols from font awesome

## Rules

Click on a tile to see it. Click on another to see if there's a match. Repeat the process until you get a
complete set of matched tiles.
The number of moves and the time taken to complete the game is recorded. In this version of the game if you click on an 
already matched tile or a tile that is already turned over this will not be counted in your total moves taken (as requested by reviewer).
For a more challenging versin of the game the Master branch of this repository has a version where bad clicks count in your moves total:-)
